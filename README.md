# Tinvio-Assessment
This is my submission for Tinvio's internship assessment. In order to run the application, you could use one of two ways:

* Clone the repository into your computer. Then, in the terminal, run `npm install` to install all the relevant modules. Once that is completed, simply run `npm start` in the terminal and connect to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

* Alternatively, visit the website [https://tinvio-assessment.herokuapp.com/](https://tinvio-assessment.herokuapp.com/) to view the application.

In this submission, the minimum features required have been implemented, which are: 

* To fetch data from an API and display them on the website

* Modify the fetched data in certain ways to fit the mock reference 

* Styled website to be as close to the mock reference as possible

In addition, some "Good To Have" objectives have been implemented:

* Mobile responsiveness

* Hosted on website [https://tinvio-assessment.herokuapp.com/](https://tinvio-assessment.herokuapp.com/)

Improvements that I would like to implement in the future: 

* Enable the switching of users 

* Allow the full display of post body upon clicking a post. 

Hours spent on the submission: *16*
