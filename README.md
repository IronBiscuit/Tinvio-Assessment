# Tinvio-Assessment

This is my submission for Tinvio's internship assessment. The minimum features required have been implemented, which are: 

* To fetch data from an API and display them on the website

* Modify the fetched data in certain ways to fit the mock reference 

* Styled website to be as close to the mock reference as possible

In order to run the application, you could use one of two ways:



In addition, some "Good To Have" objectives have been implemented:

* Mobile responsiveness

* Hosted on website [https://tinvio-assessment.herokuapp.com/](https://tinvio-assessment.herokuapp.com/)

Improvements that I would like to implement in the future: 

* Enable the switching of users 

* Allow the full display of post body upon clicking a post.
